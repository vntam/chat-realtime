# API Gateway URL (Single Entry Point for REST API)
VITE_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:3000

# WebSocket URLs (Direct connection to services)
# Note: WebSocket connections bypass Gateway for better performance
VITE_CHAT_WS_URL=http://localhost:3002
VITE_NOTIFICATION_WS_URL=http://localhost:3003

# For production:
# VITE_API_GATEWAY_URL=https://your-api-gateway.onrender.com
# VITE_CHAT_WS_URL=https://your-chat-service.onrender.com
# VITE_NOTIFICATION_WS_URL=https://your-notification-service.onrender.com

# Architecture:
#   - REST API (HTTP) → API Gateway → Services
#   - WebSocket (WS) → Direct to Services (bypass Gateway)
